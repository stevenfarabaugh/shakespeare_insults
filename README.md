# shakespeare_insults
insults of a shakespearian nature

I have placed this script in the cgi-bin directory of an apache server. (/var/www/cgi-bin/)

[FUTURE] set up a server to register statistics on which insult is generated

[FUTURE] set up a "rating" where people can select a 1-10 rating on the insult, and record statistics

[FUTURE] add more insults. (find a liberal arts person to comb through the bards numerous work and generate more than 150 options.)
